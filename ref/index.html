            <h2>Extra information</h2>

            <p>Do not use the format above for corporate authors <span>(Tate Modern should be listed as Tate Modern)</span>.</p>
            <p>If the source has two authors, separate their names with 'and'. If there are more than two authors, separate their names with commas, with 'and' before the last name.</p>
            <p>If you refer to an organisation that has changed its name, you should use the name that it was known as at the time of the source's publication.</p>
            <p>Company/organisation names which start with words such as 'A', 'An', or 'The' should be alphabetised under the first major word.</p>
            <p>If the information source has no date, use "(undated)" instead.</p>
            <p>Use lowercase letters in alphabetical order after publication dates to distinguish multiple sources from an author in the same year <span>((King, 1977a) followed by (King, 1977b))</span>.</p>
            <p>Titles of non-journal sources should be in sentence case and italics.</p>

You should:<br>- use double quotation marks at the beginning and end of the text<br>- follow the quotation with the in-text citation<br>- use ellipses (...) if you omit part of the text</p>
            <p>Long quotations are generally longer than two lines. You should:<br>- start the quotation on a new line<br>- indent the quotation<br>- follow the quotation with the in-text citation<br>- start your analysis of the quotation on a new line.</p>
