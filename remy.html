            <p>In the summer months of 2020, the break between my second and third year of university, <a href="https://joepitts.co.uk"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my friend Joe</a> and I decided to collaborate on a project. The two of us had each been trying new recipes and were using our phones' notes applications to store those that we liked best. In a conversation about our recipes, we discovered that we had both found our note-taking applications a little lacking in functionality for our intended purposes, so we began to identify solutions to our problem.</p>
