                    I'm a third year computer science student at the University of Lincoln, planning to undertake a master's degree by research, specialising in human-computer interaction. In my free time, I like to work on projects that I share here. I am also a keen photographer and I enjoy playing guitar and listening to audiobooks.

                    <p>
                        <span class="sub">Highly motivated</span> and <span class="sub">eager to learn</span>. After getting lower-than-expected A-level results, I challenged myself to get a first-class grade in each year of my university degree. So far, I have been able to achieve this goal.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Experience <span class="sub">working in groups</span> involving <span class="sub">meeting deadlines</span> and <span class="sub">communicating</span> with members working on different aspects of our projects. I have also previously <span class="sub">successfully led a group project</span> which was awarded a first-class grade.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have experience with multiple coding languages through university modules (<span class="sub">C#, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</span>), my A-level course (<span class="sub">Python</span>), and my own extra-curricular projects (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). My competency in many of these languages has been recognised through my university grades and Microsoft Technology Associate awards.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have used <span class="sub">Adobe XD</span>, <span class="sub">Figma</span>, and <span class="sub">Visual Studio</span> multiple times throughout my university course and in my own extra-curricular projects.

                    <p>
                        <span class="sub">Customer Care, McDonald’s 0097, Lincoln</span>, September 2018 - November 2019<br>
                        In this role, I was responsible for restocking and maintaining a clean and tidy dining area, dealing with customer inquiries, and resolving any customer issues. This job helped me immensely improve skills such as teamwork, time management, and working in wildly varying paces of environment.
