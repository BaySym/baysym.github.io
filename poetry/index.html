            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>For six weeks across July and August 2020, I participated in the University of Lincoln&#39;s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Scheme. The project I worked on involved interaction design for AI-generated poetry, exploring the possibility of AI one day generating bespoke media based ona user&#39;s interests, surroundings, or input.I worked on the project alone but had weekly meetings with my supervisor.</p>
            <h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>
            <p>Before I began work on the project, I found some relevant literature to further educate myself in the field of AI-generated media and to seek inspiration for my upcoming designs.</p>
            <p>I collated a list of choices I would have to consider before developing my designs, including who the system would be targeted at, how they would interact with the system, and how they would use the system&#39;s output.</p>
            <p>Using the list of choices I had found, I picked different answers to each question and made a note of the outcomes. I used these aswers to develop three concepts, each with its own set of choices. The initial concepts that I came up with were:</p>
            <p>Screens embedded into the backs of public transport seating, allowing passengers to randomly generate lines of poetry and create a full poem line by line.
            <img src="../img/concept1.png" alt="A sketch of my first concept."></p>
            <p>A mobile application in which users can generate random poems based on their own input of photos, words, or their location and display the result on nearby real-world broadcast screens such as digital billboards.
            <img src="../img/concept2.png" alt="A sketch of my second concept."></p>
            <p>A system to help users spend time on their mobile devices more mindfully by offering relevant poetry to help them reflect on their device usage sessions. This was the idea that I decided to continue developing.
