        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the summer of 2020, I participated in the University of Lincoln’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Scheme. The project I worked on involved interaction design for AI-generated poetry, exploring the possibility of AI one day being able to generate bespoke media for a user. The wider idea considered television programmes, music, and films, but my project was focused on poetry.</p>
        <p>The project’s objective was to develop a conceptual use case for AI-generated bespoke poetry. I had six weeks to complete the project, in which I worked alone other than weekly meetings with my supervisor.</p>

        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>As the brief was broad, the initial goal was to narrow the scope down into something I could focus on. I assembled a list of questions I would have to answer before designing a concept, such as “who will use the system?”, “how will they interact with it?”, and “how would they use the system’s output?”</p>
        <p>Using different combinations of answers to these questions, I came up with three use cases and sketched them. My first idea used screens embedded into the backs of public transport seating, allowing passengers to randomly generate lines of poetry and create a full poem line by line.</p>
        <div class="cs-img-cn"><img src="concept1.png" alt="A sketch of my first concept."></div>
        <p>Another idea was a mobile application in which users can generate random poems based on their own input of photos, words, or their location and display the result on nearby real-world broadcast screens such as digital billboards.</p>
        <div class="cs-img-cn"><img src="concept2.png" alt="A sketch of my second concept."></div>
        <p>My final idea involved a system to help users spend time on their mobile devices more mindfully by offering relevant poetry to help them reflect on their device usage sessions. This was the idea that I decided to continue developing.</p>
