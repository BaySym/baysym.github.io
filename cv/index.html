                <p>I am a third-year computer science student at the University of Lincoln, intending to work toward a masterâ€™s degree in user experience design. My main interests are UXD, human-computer interaction, the concept of technology becoming an integral part of our daily lives.</p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>University of Lincoln</h2>
                <p>BSc (Hons) Computer Science (I am currently in my final year)</p>
                <h3>2018 - present</h3>
                <br>
                <h2>Sir John Nelthorpe School, Brigg</h2>
                <p>A-levels: computer science (B), mathematics (C), physics (C)</p>
                <p>GCSEs: 1 A*, 7 As, 2 Bs</p>
                <h3>2011 - 2018</h3>

                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>Interaction design for automated poetry generation</h2>
                <h3>July - August 2020</h3>
                <p>My role in this project was to develop a concept of a use case for AI-generated poetry. I worked on the project alone for size weeks, with weekly supervision meetings, using Figma for digital mock-ups. Throughout my time working on the project, I gained valuable insight into the methodology of interaction design and the fact that the brief was not my own creation meant that I gained some experience of working for a client-like figure.</p>

                <br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Highly motivated and eager to learn.</span> After getting lower-than-expected A-level results, I challenged myself to get a first-class grade in each year of my university degree. So far, I have been able to achieve this goal.</p><br>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 600">Experience working in groups</span> involving meeting deadlines and communicating with members working on different aspects of our projects. I have also previously successfully lead a group project which was awarded a first-class grade. </p><br>
                <p>I have experience with <span style="font-weight: 600">multiple coding languages</span> through university modules (C#, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), my A-level course (Python), and my own extra-curricular projects (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). My competency in many of these languages has been recognised through my university grades and Microsoft Technology Associate awards.</p><br>
                <p>I have used <span style="font-weight: 600">Adobe XD, Figma, and Visual Studio</span> multiple times throughout my university course and in my own extra-curricular projects.</p>
