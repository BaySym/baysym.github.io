            <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
            <p>Complete workshops 1-6, then write a report which presents an analysis of your street scene, using the concepts and theory presented in your lectures. The report should contain the following sections, each around 500 words and fully referenced to back up your arguments:</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <h3>Graphic fidelity: </h3>
                <p>This section should discuss the graphical fidelity of the scene, and how it might affect users’ sense of presence. You should consider positive and negative points and consider how fidelity can be optimised.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Locomotion: </h3>
                <p>This section should discuss 3 different locomotion methods, their appropriateness for the simulation, and each might affect users’ sense of presence.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Agent behaviour: </h3>
                <p>This section should discuss agent behaviour and how it might affect users’ experience (including, but not limited to, sense of presence), what improvements could be made, and how they would improve user experience?</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>VR sickness: </h3>
                <p>This section should discuss factors that might affect users experience of VR sickness in the simulation, and what improvements could be made to help users overcome VR sickness.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>References <span>unlimited length</span></h3>
            </div>
            <p>You may vary the amount you write for each section, but the report must not exceed a maximum of 2000 words excluding references  (presentation penalties may be applied if the maximum word count is exceeded).</p>

            <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
            <p>Researchers are already attempting to find new and beneficial ways to use AR in education and training situations. The military and healthcare industries, in particular, are developing powerful AR training simulations.</p>
            <p>Your task is to develop an educational/informative Augmented Reality mobile app which utilises the AR recognition and tracking capabilities provided in workshops, and your own independent study. This must be accompanied by the development and integration of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) which disseminates additional content/information.</p>
            <p>You may choose the specific educational theme, but your AR experience must:</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>1. Combine virtual and real information, with the real world as the primary place of action.</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. Be interactive with real-time updates to content or object (GUI).</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. Have virtual information registered in 3D space, in the physical environment.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You must also write a report consisting of the following sections, supported by relevant methodologies and academic literature where appropriate:</p>
            <div class="indented">
                <h3>Overview <span>max 500 words</span>: </h3>
                <p>This section should discuss the graphical fidelity of the scene, and how it might affect users’ sense of presence. You should consider positive and negative points and consider how fidelity can be optimised.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Development <span>max 750 words</span>: </h3>
                <p>Discuss your development including any technical implementation(s) for example handling Interruptions or using audio and haptics to enhance the immersive experience. This should include a rationale behind your choice of implementation and the intended user experience.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Analysis and evaluation <span>max 750 words</span>: </h3>
                <p>This could include a discussion on environment, interactions and patterns, cognitive tunneling, diegetic/ non diegetic interfaces and/or other aspects that you think are relevant. You should also discuss any negative aspects.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>References <span>unlimited length</span></h3>
            </div>
            <p>Each section must not exceed the maximum word count indicated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>VR first class criteria</h2>
            <p>All parts ofthe indicated workshops have been implemented, and run error free. Significant additional effort has been expended on the production qualityby adding minoradditional featuresor polishing the implementationtohigh degree</p>
            <p>Each section sections is well constructed and makes good use of materials from lectures, and very significant referencing, to support a complete analysis. Knowledge gained from independent study in all sections. Analysis is exceptionally well constructed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>AR first class criteria</h2>
            <p>All of the tasks have been implemented and run without significant error. This is a complete implementation. All suggested stretch tasks have also been implemented.</p>
            <p>There is evidence that thought has been given to the user experience and novel use of AR to develop a functional and intuitive interface.</p>
            <p>Most types of existing AR have been identified with relevant supporting use cases with good contextualisation, academically justified.</p>
