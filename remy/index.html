        <h1>Remy</h1>

        <p>In the summer of 2020, <a href="https://www.joepitts.co.uk/" target="_bla|nk">my friend Joe</a> and I were talking about how we'd both been getting more into eating healthy and cooking from scratch recently. We each had our phone's notes apps full of recipes that we accessed by scrolling through reminders and to-do lists and we had both planned on creating a dedicated page on our respective websites for reciple storage.</p>
        <p>After some discussion, we decided to collaborate on a dedicated recipe management app, something that we would both find extremely useful: an app that would not only make it simple to write and store recipes, but also show the exactly how nutritious a meal is.</p>
