            <h2>Key parts</h2>

            <p>You should produce a <b>project proposal</b>, specifying a clear, specific, academically justified, and appropriately scoped aim and set of objectives. In addition, this document should include a review of project progress. This review should also address questions such as:<br>
               - What is the rationale for the project?<br>
               - What are the milestones or objectives of your proposed project?<br>
               - What are the potential risks to your project and how mught you mitigate them?<br>
               - What is your preferred research and data gathering methodology?</p>

            <p>You should also produce <b>ethical approval</b> (EA) documents which outline the ethical considerations you have made wwhen developing your project. You must read the information regarding ethical guidelines<!--, <a href="">here</a>-->. After discussion with your supervisor (and maybe others), you must complete the required EA forms which must be submitted as part of assignment one. EA forms are must be approved by two markers, until which no marks will be awarded for this module.</p>

            <h2>Proposal document</h2>
            <p>It should be noted that the project proposal is not a substantial piece of work - it should be brief and to the point, but it does require considerable thought and analysis. The project proposal must be within 10% of 1300 words (1170 to 1430) and include the following sections:</p>
            <p><b>Abstract</b>: an abstract outlining the project basis, its aims, work that has been carried out, and work that has yet to be undertaken.</p>
            <p><b>Introduction</b>: an introduction, of no more than 300 words, which explains the background and reationale for carrying out the project and sets out why the project is relevant and beneficial with respect to your particular programme of study. You should seek the advice of your supervisor to ensure that your project topic is appropriate for your programme of study</p>
            <p><b>Aims and objectives</b>: The aim of the project and the objectives which must be met in order to achieve this aim. The aim is decomposed into several objectives. Meeting these objectives will contribute to achieving the stated aim. The objectives should be specific, measurable, assignable, relevant, and time-based (SMART).</p>
            <p><b>Academic literature</b>: A review of at least five pieces of academic literature which you have identified as being directly relevant to the project. This should establish the context and rationale for your study and confirm your choice of research focus/question. This section is to be no longer than 500 words and needs to be a coherent, single body of work rather than a collection of individual reviews.</p>
            <p><b>Project plan and risk analysis</b>: A documented project plan (including your research methodology) which encompasses the whole of the timeframe for the project and shows time scales and milestones for achieving each of the project objectives. This may take the form of a Gantt chart. The level of granularity for this plan will be no more detailed than one week. The risk analysis should identify and explain the specific risks, assign likelihood and assessed impact to each risk and set out how each risk might be managed or mitigated. Generic risks (e.g. illness, loss of data, IT problems etc.) are common to all projects and should NOT be included here. This written explanation is to be no longer than 400 words.</p>
            <p><b>References</b>: A list of references, in accordance with the University of Lincoln Harvard Referencing Guide.</p>
